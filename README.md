# TrendHive
TrendHive is a full-stack fashion e-commerce web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (frontend) with a Node.js (Express) + SQLite (via sql.js) backend. It allows users to browse products, add them to cart, and place orders — all stored persistently in a lightweight SQL database.
